There's a party in the house and we'll be rockin' tonight
So bring your body with you baby and I'll make you feel right
It's a freaky celebration of a natural kind
And the pleasure you'll experience will blow your mind

Freestyle's kickin' in the house tonight
Move your body from left to right
To all you freaks, don't stop the rock
'Cause Freestyle's speakin' and you know we're hot

Freestyle's kickin' in the house tonight
Move your body from left to right
To all you freaks, don't stop the rock
'Cause Freestyle's speakin' and you know we're hot

Everybody will be dancing to the beat on the floor
You will encounter situations never thought of before
Satisfaction's guaranteed if you know what I mean
And when you walk into the door it's such a freaky scene

Freestyle's kickin' in the house tonight
Move your body from left to right
To all you freaks, don't stop the rock
'Cause Freestyle's speakin' and you know we're hot

All you ladies interested in the words I speak
We will be rockin' like this every night of the week
And all you fellows tell the ladies "Don't Stop the Rock"
Because you know that we'll be jammin' all around the clock

I went to a party and what did I see
The girls were wearing leather skirts and see-through jeans
I asked the deejay to tell me what was going on
He said Freestyle's having a Freak-A-Thon

Freestyle's kickin' in the house tonight
Move your body from left to right
To all you freaks, don't stop the rock
A Freak-A-Thon

Freestyle's kickin' in the house tonight
Move your body from left to right
To all you freaks, don't stop the rock
A Freak-A-Thon
