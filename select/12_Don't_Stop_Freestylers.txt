Don't stop
The bass is kicking
The bass is kicking

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away
Shake your body, shake your body
Shake your body, go way down

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away
Shake your body, shake your body
Shake your body, go way down

I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down
'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down

'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down
'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down

'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down
'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down

'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down
'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down

'Cause I can't go on, stop rock
Can't go go, can't go go, stop rock
Can't go go, can't go go
Stop rockin' the tune

'Cause I cant go go, can't go go, stop rock
Can't go go, stop rock, can't go go, can't go go
Stop rock, can't go go, can't go go
Stop rockin' the tune 'cause I
The bass is kicking

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away
Shake your body, shake your body
Shake your body, go way down

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away
Shake your body, shake your body
Shake your body, go way down

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away
Shake your body, shake your body
Shake your body, go way down

I knew, you were the one, the only one
To give, my baby, to give my soul away

Don't stop
I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
'Cause I, get down, 'cause I, get down
'Cause I can't go on, stop rockin' the tune
