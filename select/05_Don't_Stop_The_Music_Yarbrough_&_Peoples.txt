Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you know you've got me mesmerized
With the beat I always fantasize
Don't stop the music 'cause it tends to soothe
I can tell you want to groove

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music
The beat keep goin' 'round and 'round (don't you stop it, don't you stop)
Turns me upside down (don't stop the music)

I just wanna rock you (all, all night long)
All night long (to my love song, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
I just wanna rock you (Just wanna rock you)
All night long (Yeah!)
I got a love song (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!)

Everything we do is right on time
The beat's so smooth it blows my mind
Don't stop the music, it's so satisfying
It feels so good to me, there is no denying

Just because it's two o'clock
Don't stop the music
Don't you feel like dancing and prancing?
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

You don't really wanna stop, no
You don't really wanna stop, uh-uh
You don't really wanna stop, no
You don't really wanna stop

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

You've got me moving, you've got me grooving
Don't stop the music

Don't you feel like dancing
I can tell you on a dance
Don't you feel like dancing
You've got me grooving, you've got me moving
Don't stop the music, yeah
Don't you stop it, don't you stop (Don't stop)
Don't stop the music (the music)

(I just wanna rock you) I just wanna rock you (All night long)
All night long (To my love song), ohohohoho
(I just wanna rock you) I just wanna rock you (All night long)
All night long, hey (To my love song, love song, love song, love song, love song)

I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie
I can tell you wanna boogie

Don't you stop it (You don't really wanna stop), don't you stop (No)
Don't stop the music (You don't really wanna stop, uh-uh)
Don't you stop it (You don't really wanna stop), don't you stop (No)
Don't stop the music (You don't really wanna stop)

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop

Just because it's two o'clock (Don't stop)
Don't mean that we have to stop (Don't stop)
Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop (Don't stop)
Just because it's two o'clock (Don't stop)
Don't mean that we have to stop
Just because it's two o'clock
Don't mean that we have to stop (Don't stop)
Just because it's two o'clock (Don't stop)
Don't mean that we have to stop
Boogie with me all night long

Don't you stop it, don't you stop
Don't stop the music

Don't you stop it (You don't really wanna stop), don't you stop (No)
Don't stop the music (You don't really wanna stop, uh-uh)
Don't you stop it (You don't really wanna stop), don't you stop (No)
Don't stop the music (You don't really wanna stop)
Don't you stop it, don't you stop
